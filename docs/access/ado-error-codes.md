# ADO Error Codes

In addition to the provider errors returned in the [Error](error-object-ado.md) objects of the [Errors](errors-collection-ado.md) collection, ADO itself can return errors to the exception-handling mechanism of your run-time environment. Use the error trapping mechanism your programming language, such as the **On Error** statement in Microsoft Visual Basic or the **try-catch** block in Microsoft Visual C++ or Microsoft Visual J++ to capture ADO errors. 
  
For the list of ADO error codes, see [ErrorValueEnum](errorvalueenum.md).
