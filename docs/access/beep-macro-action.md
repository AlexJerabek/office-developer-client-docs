# Beep Macro Action

You can use the **Beep** action to sound a beep tone through the computer's speaker. 
  
## Setting

The **Beep** action doesn't have any arguments. 
  
## Remarks

You can use the **Beep** action to signal the following occurrences: 
  
- Important screen changes have occurred.
    
- The wrong kind of data has been entered in a control. For example, the user has entered numeric data in a text box control.
    
- A macro has reached a specified point or has completed its actions.
    
The frequency and duration of the beep depend on the hardware, which may vary between computers.
  
To run the **Beep** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **Beep** method of the **DoCmd** object.
