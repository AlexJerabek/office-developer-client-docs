You can use the **CancelRecordChange** action to cancel the changes applied to a record in a **[CreateRecord](createrecord-data-block.md)** or **[EditRecord](editrecord-data-block.md)** data block before the changes are committed. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The **CancelRecordChange** action is available only in Data Macros. 
  
## Remarks

When you call the **CancelRecordChange** action, the **CreateRecord** or **EditRecord** data block is exited immediately.
