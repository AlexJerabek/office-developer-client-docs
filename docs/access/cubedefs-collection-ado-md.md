# CubeDefs Collection (ADO MD)

Contains the [CubeDef](cubedef-object-ado-md.md) objects that represent a cube from a multidimensional catalog. 
  
## Remarks

- Obtain the number of objects in the collection with the [Count](count-property-ado.md) property. 
    
- Return an object from the collection with the default [Item](item-property-ado.md) property. 
    
- Update the objects in the collection from the provider with the [Refresh](refresh-method-ado.md) method.
