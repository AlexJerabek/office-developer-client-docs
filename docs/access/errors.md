# Errors

Any operation involving ADO objects can generate one or more provider errors. As each error occurs, one or more **Error** objects are placed in the **Errors** collection of the **Connection** object. For details about handling warnings and errors in your ADO application, see [Chapter 6: Error Handling](chapter-6-error-handling.md).
  
Application errors can be raised by a separate mechanism. For example, in Visual Basic, the **Err** object will contain application-level errors.
