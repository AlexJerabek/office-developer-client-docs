- Obtain the number of objects in the collection with the [Count](count-property-ado.md) property. 
    
- Return an object from the collection with the default [Item](item-property-ado.md) property. 
    
- Update the objects in the collection from the provider with the [Refresh](refresh-method-ado.md) method.
