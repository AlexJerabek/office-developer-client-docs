# Name Property (ADO MD)

Indicates the name of an object.
  
## Return Values

Returns a **String** and is read-only. 
  
## Remarks

You can retrieve the **Name** property of an object by an ordinal reference, after which you can refer to the object directly by name. For example, if cdf.CubeDefs(0).Name yields "Bobs Video Store", you can refer to this [CubeDef](cubedef-object-ado-md.md) as cdf.CubeDefs("Bobs Video Store").
