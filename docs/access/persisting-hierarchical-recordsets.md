# Persisting Hierarchical Recordsets

You can save a hierarchical **Recordset** to a file in either ADTG or XML format by calling the [Save](save-method-ado.md) method. However, two limitations apply when saving hierarchical **Recordset** s in XML format: You cannot save in XML if the hierarchical **Recordset** contains pending updates, and you cannot save a parameterized hierarchical **Recordset**.
