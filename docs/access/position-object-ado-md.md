# Position Object (ADO MD)

Represents a set of one or more members of different dimensions that defines a point along an axis.
  
## Remarks

With the properties and collections of a **Position** object you can do the following: 
  
- Use the **Ordinal** property to return the ordinal position of the **Position** along the [Axis](axis-object-ado-md.md).
    
- Use the [Members](members-collection-ado-md.md) collection to return the members that make up the position along the **Axis**.
