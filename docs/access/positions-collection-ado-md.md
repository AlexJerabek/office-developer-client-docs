# Positions Collection (ADO MD)

Contains the [Position](position-object-ado-md.md) objects that define a point on an axis. 
  
## Remarks

 **Positions** is a standard ADO collection. With the properties and methods of a collection, you can do the following: 
  
- Obtain the number of objects in the collection with the [Count](count-property-ado.md) property. 
    
- Return an object from the collection with the default [Item](item-property-ado.md) property. 
    
- Update the objects in the collection from the provider with the [Refresh](refresh-method-ado.md) method.
