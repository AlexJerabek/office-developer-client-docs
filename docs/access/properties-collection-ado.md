# Properties Collection (ADO)

Contains all the [Property](property-object-ado.md) objects for a specific instance of an object. 
  
## Remarks

Some ADO objects have a **Properties** collection made up of **Property** objects. Each **Property** object corresponds to a characteristic of the ADO object specific to the provider. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> See the [Property](property-object-ado.md) object topic for a more detailed explanation of how to use **Property** objects. 
  
The **Dynamic Properties** of the **Recordset** object go out of scope (become unavailable) when the **Recordset** is closed.
