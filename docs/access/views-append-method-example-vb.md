# Views Append Method Example (VB)

The following code demonstrates how to use a [Command](command-object-ado.md) object and the [Views](views-collection-adox.md) collection [Append](append-method-adox-views.md) method to create a new view in the underlying data source. 
  
```
 
' BeginCreateViewVB 
Sub Main() 
 On Error GoTo CreateViewError 
 
 Dim cmd As New ADODB.Command 
 Dim cat As New ADOX.Catalog 
 
 ' Open the Catalog 
 cat.ActiveConnection = _ 
 "Provider='Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0';" &amp; _ 
 "Data Source='c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\" &amp; _ 
 "Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb';" 
 
 ' Create the command representing the view. 
 cmd.CommandText = "Select * From Customers" 
 
 ' Create the new View 
 cat.Views.Append "AllCustomers", cmd 
 
 'Clean up 
 Set cat.ActiveConnection = Nothing 
 Set cat = Nothing 
 Set cmd = Nothing 
 Exit Sub 
 
CreateViewError: 
 
 Set cat = Nothing 
 Set cmd = Nothing 
 
 If Err <> 0 Then 
 MsgBox Err.Source &amp; "-->" &amp; Err.Description, , "Error" 
 End If 
End Sub 
' EndCreateViewVB 

```
