# XML Recordset Persistence Scenario

## XML Recordset Persistence Scenario

In this scenario, you will create an Active Server Pages (ASP) application that saves the contents of a **Recordset** object directly to the ASP **Response** object. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> This scenario requires that your server have Internet Information Server 5.0 (IIS) or later installed. 
  
The returned **Recordset** is displayed in Internet Explorer using an [RDS.DataControl](datacontrol-object-rds.md).
  
The following steps are necessary to create this scenario:
  
1. Set up the application.
    
2. Get the data.
    
3. Send the data.
    
4. Receive and display the data.
